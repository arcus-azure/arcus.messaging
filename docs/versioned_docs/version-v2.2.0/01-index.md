# Introduction
Welcome to the Arcus Messaging site! ðŸŽ‰

# What is Arcus Messaging?
Arcus Messaging is an umbrella term for a set of NuGet packages `Arcus.Messaging.*` that helps with abstracting away boilerplate code when integrating with messaging systems like Azure Service Bus. It allows you to focus on implementing business logic instead of spending time with message picking, connections, deserialization, and the like.

# Why should I use Arcus Messaging?
Messaging systems can become quite complex. Different message types, properties... means different message routing. This tedious boilerplate infrastructure work is often common across messaging projects.

Instead of duplicating the work, and keeping your solution stable/tested; Arcus Messaging provides a simple/secure way of setting up message routing/handling for all your projects!

# How to use Arcus Messaging?
