# Introduction
Arcus Messaging is a library that helps with the integration of messaging systems like queues or event subscriptions and allows you to focus on implementing business logic when processing messages instead of spending time with message peaking, connections, deserialization, and other infrastructure code that takes up time.

## Guides
* Migrate from v0.x to v1.0 ([docs](./03-Guides/migration-guide-v1.0.md))

# Installation
The packages are available on NuGet, for example:

```shell
PM > Install-Package Arcus.Messaging.Pumps.ServiceBus
